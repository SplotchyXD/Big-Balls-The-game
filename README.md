# Big-Balls-The-Game
I made this back in 2021 for a course i had about making games inside Unity.
The games idea is to see how big of a score you can get by hitting score dots and treasure dots, there are also hostile dots that once being hit will end your run.
There is also a lava wall that will follow you constantly but it is pretty slow.
The game is made for mobile, i tested the game on android but it should be functional on ios too.
Feel free to take this subpar code from 3 years ago and do something cool with it.
